#My HW3 Reflection

start here from instructions in prompt

Confidence Check: 
After two weeks in WRIT40363, I feel fairly confident with the basics of HTML. I understand structure, headings, and semantic elements, and I feel solid with things like adding text, lists, and links. What still challenges me is remembering all the little details of syntax. Oone missing tag or slash can throw off everything, and I'm still getting used to catching those mistakes quickly.

Learning Curve: 
Git and GitHub have been the steepest learning curve so far. I honestly didn't expect version control to feel so complicated at first, but I've started to see why it's so important. What surprised me is how Git tracks every single change, almost like a history of my work. It was harder than I thought to understand the push/pull workflow, but once I practiced it, it made more sense.

Problem-Solving Growth: 
When I hit problems this week, like code not rendering or getting stuck in Git, I didn't panic as much as I did in Week 1. I tried troubleshooting step by step, checking my syntax, looking things up online, and asking classmates when needed. Compared to Week 1, I'm already approaching issues with a calmer mindset, treating them as part of the process instead of something to get frustrated by.

Professional Mindset: 
Shifting from "just making web pages" to thinking about semantic HTML and version control feels like a big step. It makes the work feel more professional and purposeful, like I'm not just coding for myself but creating something that's meant to be accessible and reliable for others. That excites me, though I'm still a little nervous about the technical side keeping up with my creative ideas.

Week 2 Reflection: 
My biggest "aha moment" was when semantic HTML finally clicked, realizing that tags aren't just about looks but about meaning, accessibility, and structure. Understanding why I'm using certain elements (like headings or alt text) made the process feel less like memorizing and more like communicating through code.

Looking Forward: 
Based on my experience so far, I'm really curious to dive into CSS next. I'm excited to see how styling can transform a plain page into something polished, but I'm also a little nervous about how many new rules and properties there are to learn.

Support and Resources: 
Hands-on practice in labs has been the most helpful part of learning so far, because I can immediately apply concepts instead of just hearing about them. Going forward, I think I'll benefit from more peer collaboration. Sometimes just talking through a problem with classmates makes it easier to solve.
