### 4. Deploy to GitHub Pages
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Redesign portfolio with it-girl black/white/metallic/red theme"
git push origin main
```

Then enable GitHub Pages in repository settings if not already enabled.

### 5. Optional Enhancements
Consider adding later:
- [ ] Mobile hamburger menu (nav currently hides on small screens)
