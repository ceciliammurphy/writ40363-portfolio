        <h2>Background</h2>

        <p>I'm an only child, but I've never really felt alone because my dog, Misty, is like my little sister. Growing up, TCU was always in the picture. My dad is an alum and a huge Horned Frog fan, so his love for the school definitely influenced me. Still, it wasn't until I toured the campus that I knew without a doubt that TCU was my dream school. Ironically, every other school I applied to was in New England, but something about TCU just pulled me in, and I know I'd choose it every time.</p>

        <h2>Education</h2>

        <p>I'm wrapping up my time at TCU, and while journalism is my main focus, I've been leaning into learning new skills that can round me out professionally. Coding and web authoring are big onesâ€”I'll be honest, it doesn't come naturally to me, but I'm excited to push myself in this area and see how it can tie into building my future brand.</p>

        <h2>Interests</h2>

        <p>Dance has always been my first love. I grew up dancing, and contemporary is my favorite style to perform, but I'll forever love watching ballet - especially Swan Lake, which makes me cry every time. Outside of dance, traveling is a huge passion of mine, and New York City is hands-down my dream place to live. I've known since seventh grade that I belonged there, and that hasn't changed a bit.</p>

        <h2>My Goals</h2>

        <p>For this class, my biggest goal is to get more comfortable with coding and web authoring so I can actually put it to use. Beyond that, I want to take what I've learned and use it to help me creatively and professionally, especially as I start shaping my career and personal brand.</p>
