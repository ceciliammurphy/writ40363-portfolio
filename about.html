        <h2><strong>Background</strong></h2>

        <p>I'm an only child, but I've never really felt alone because my dog, Misty, is like my little sister. Growing up, TCU was always in the picture. My dad is an alum and a huge Horned Frog fan, so his love for the school definitely influenced me. Still, it wasn't until I toured the campus that I knew without a doubt that TCU was my dream school. Ironically, every other school I applied to was in New England, but something about TCU just pulled me in, and I know I'd choose it every time.</p>

        <h2><strong>Skills and Learning</strong></h2>

        <p>I've always been strong in communication and storytelling, whether that's through writing, presenting, or connecting with people. Journalism has really sharpened my ability to research, ask good questions, and explain ideas clearly. At the same time, I've developed creative skills in dance and digital media that help me think about expression beyond just words. Right now, I'm focused on growing my technical side, learning tools like HTML, CSS, and other digital platforms, so I can combine creativity with technology. I'm also learning how to manage projects more efficiently and adapt when I run into challenges. Overall, I'd say my biggest strength is blending people-focused communication with a willingness to keep learning new skills that stretch me.</p>

        <h2><strong>My Goals</strong></h2>

        <p>For this class, my biggest goal is to get more comfortable with coding and web authoring so I can actually put it to use. Beyond that, I want to take what I've learned and use it to help me creatively and professionally, especially as I start shaping my career and personal brand.</p>

        <h2><strong>Interests</strong></h2>

        <p>Dance has always been my first love and the thing that shaped so much of who I am. I grew up training in multiple styles, but contemporary has always been my favorite to perform because of how expressive and versatile it feels. At the same time, I'll always admire the discipline and artistry of ballet. Swan Lake still makes me cry every time I watch it. Outside the studio, traveling is one of my biggest passions. I love exploring new places, cultures, and experiences, and I know that New York City is where I ultimately want to be. Ever since seventh grade, I've felt like I belong there, and that dream has only grown stronger. Beyond dance and travel, I also love connecting with people, whether through writing, sharing stories, or just everyday conversations. I see those passions all tying together in the kind of creative, people-centered career I want to build.</p>
