# Project Zed: AI-Assisted Web Application

> **WRIT 40363 - Digital Culture and Digital Arts**  
> Fall 2025 | Final Project

## 📋 Project Overview

This is **Project Zed**, an AI-assisted web application built to demonstrate upskilled techniques from WRIT 40363. This project represents the culmination of skills learned across Projects 1-3, enhanced through strategic collaboration with AI development tools.

**Project Goal:** Build an ambitious web application that pushes beyond previous course projects, using AI as a development partner to accelerate learning and tackle new technical challenges.

---

## 🎯 What is "Upskilling with AI"?

This project focuses on:
- Taking techniques from Projects 1-3 and pushing them further
- Learning new approaches through AI collaboration
- Building features I wasn't previously confident to tackle
- Refining code quality and design thinking
- Gaining insight from both successes and failures

**Important Note:** This project prioritizes learning and growth over perfection. A partially-working app with deep reflection is more valuable than a perfect app without understanding.

## 🤖 AI Collaboration

This project was developed in partnership with AI development tools. Full documentation of the AI collaboration process can be found in [`AI_COLLABORATION_LOG.md`](./AI_COLLABORATION_LOG.md), including:

- AI tools used and their specific contributions
- Key learning moments and breakthroughs
- Challenges encountered and how they were resolved
- Evolution of prompting strategies
- Sample conversations (debugging, concept learning, code review)

**Key Principle:** AI was used as a learning accelerator and development partner, not as a replacement for understanding. Every line of code in this project can be explained and justified.
